% Exercise 13.1
\begin{exercise}
    Let $X$ be a topological space; let $A$ be a subset of $X$.
    Suppose that for each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset A$.
    Show that $A$ is open in $X$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    Consider the set $B = \bigcup U$.
    Since $B$ is the union of open sets, it is open.
    We claim that $A = B$. 
    Indeed, let $a \in A$.
    Then $a \in U$ for some open set $U$.
    But then $a \in \bigcup U = B$ so $A \subseteq B$.
    Now let $b \in B$. 
    That is, $b \in U$ for some $U \subset A$.
    Then $b \in A$ so $B \subseteq A$, proving that $A = B$. 
    Therefore, $A$ is open.
\end{solution}

% Exercise 13.2
\begin{exercise}
    Consider the nine topologies on the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$ indicated in Example 1 of \S 12.
    Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies, determine whether they are comparable, and if so, which is the finer.
\end{exercise}
